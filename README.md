### Abstract
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, openly accessible databases, such as the ImmuneCODE database, have emerged. The MIRA data sets included in this database contain SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell receptors sequences extracted from human patients. 

Understanding T cell receptor interactions with Major Histocompatibility Class I-peptide (MHCI-peptide) complexes is pivotal for gaining a better grasp of the adaptive immune response against the COVID-19 infection. The novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the rise of rapid mutations due to the global spread may require prediction models, which could be based on deep learning frameworks.  

This paper aims at extracting and processing TCRβ-pMHCI interactions from the MIRA data set, in order to investigate whether applying a pre-existing CNN framework (NetTCR) is suitable for modelling this data. Although enough T cell beta receptors binding to the MHCI-peptide complexes could be extracted, most of them come from naïve CD8 cells sampled from healthy donors. The deep learning models created and and trained on this data set are not predictive, partially due to data pre-processing. Overall, this project has helped gaining a better understanding of the ImmuneCODE database, as well as applying some deep learning frameworks on predicting TCRβ-pMHC interactions. Taking into consideration what has been discovered in this paper might help achieving better results for future research and eventually contribute to the fight against the global pandemic.
